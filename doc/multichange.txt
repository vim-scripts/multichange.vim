INSTALLATION                                          *multichange-installation*

There are several ways to install the plugin. The recommended one is by using
Tim Pope's pathogen (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332). In
that case, you can clone the plugin's git repository like so:
>
    git clone git://github.com/AndrewRadev/multichange.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/multichange
<
If your vim configuration is under git version control, you could also set up
the repository as a submodule, which would allow you to update more easily.
The command is (provided you're in ~/.vim):
>
    git submodule add git://github.com/AndrewRadev/multichange.vim.git bundle/multichange
<

Another way is to simply copy all the essential directories inside the ~/.vim
directory: autoload, doc, plugin.


==============================================================================
USAGE                                                        *multichange-usage*

The plugin exposes a command, |:Multichange|, that enters a special "multi"
mode. In this mode, any change of a word with a "c" mapping is propagated
throughout the entire file. Example:
>
    def add(one, two):
        return one + two
<
If we wanted to rename the "one" parameter to "first" and the "two" parameter
to "second", we could do it in a number of ways using either the "." mapping
or substitutions. With multichange, we execute the |:Multichange| command, and
then perform the "cw" operation on "one" and "two" within the argument list.
Changing them to "first" and "second" will be performed for the entire file.

Note that this works similarly to the "*" mapping -- it replaces words only,
so it won't replace the "one" in "one_more_thing".

To exit "multi" mode, press <esc>. To limit the "multi" mode to only an area
of the file (for example, to rename variables within a single function
definition), select the desired area and then execute |:Multichange|.

You can also make a change in visual mode. For example, you want to change a
function name in Vimscript:
>
    function! s:BadName()
    endfunction

    call s:BadName()
<
Since ":" is not in 'iskeyword' (I think), you might have problems changing
the function name using word motions. In this case, start "multi" mode as
described above, then mark "s:BadName" in characterwise visual mode (with
"v"). After pressing "c", change the name to whatever you like. This will
propagate the same way as the word change from before. The difference is that
whatever was selected will be changed, regardless of word boundaries. So, if
you only select "Name" and change it, any encounter of "Name" will be
replaced.

Mapping ~

Typing |:Multichange| for an action like this is counterproductive. The plugin
comes with a mapping to trigger the multi mode, which comes in two parts,
configurable with |g:multichange_mapping| and |g:multichange_motion_mapping|.

The default values of both are <c-n>:
>
    let g:multichange_mapping        = '<c-n>'
    let g:multichange_motion_mapping = '<c-n>'
<
The first of these is the text object that starts multichange, so you need to
combine it with a motion. For instance, <c-n>ap would start multichange over
the next paragraph, <c-n>4j would start it over the next 4 lines and so on.

The second one is the special motion to start a multichange over the entire
buffer, so <c-n><c-n> would just trigger a global multichange. If you change
the motion mapping to, say "n":
>
    let g:multichange_motion_mapping = 'n'
<
Then the mapping for a global multichange would be <c-n>n.

My personal preference is:
>
    let g:multichange_mapping        = 'sm'
    let g:multichange_motion_mapping = 'm'
<
This means that starting a global multichange would be `smm`, while starting
one only for a ruby method would be `smam`. But this clobbers the `s` key that
some people use, so it can't be the default.


==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                  *multichange-settings*

                                                         *g:multichange_mapping*
>
    let g:multichange_mapping = '_n'
<

Default value: '<c-n>'

Controls the mapping for entering "multi" mode. Acts as a text object
(|text-objects|), which means you need to provide a motion for the range of
the multichange.

Set it to an empty string to avoid setting any mapping (you can still use the
|:Multichange| command).

                                                  *g:multichange_motion_mapping*
>
    let g:multichange_motion_mapping = 'n'
<

Default value: '<c-n>'

After triggering the multichange mapping, use this one to start a global
multichange. So, if |g:multichange_mapping| is set to "_n", and this one is at
its default value of <c-n>, then _n<c-n> would start a global multichange.

Set to an empty string to avoid setting any mapping (you can still use the
|:Multichange| command).

INTERNALS                                                *multichange-internals*

When the plugin starts "multi" mode, a buffer-local structure is instantiated
with the data for the started mode, including its boundaries, if there are
any. The "c" and "<esc>" keys are remapped in normal mode to start a
substitution and exit "multi" mode, respectively. The "c" key is also mapped
in visual mode (with |:xnoremap|, of course). Once the substitution is started
with the "c" key, a different structure is instantiated for the particular
substitution. Upon leaving insert mode, the substitution is performed and that
record is destroyed, but the "mode" record remains for the next substitution.

When <esc> is pressed, all buffer-local records are destroyed and the keys are
unmapped, and, if necessary, mapped to their old mappings. This means that it
should be safe to override "c" and <esc> to anything you like, the plugin will
restore them afterwards.

- Make it work with "i" and "a" as well as with "c".
